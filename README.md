# Welcome to my GitHub!

I created this account a long time ago, and have more recently become active in it since I moved on from my previous employer.

I am currently studying, exploring, and re-learning various technlogies, so most of the public repositories in this account are old projects. I do plan to make a few more recent projects public, but those aren't quite ready yet :)

## Previous Employer GitHub Account

GitHub [recommends using a single account](https://docs.github.com/en/account-and-profile/setting-up-and-managing-your-personal-account-on-github/managing-your-personal-account/merging-multiple-personal-accounts) to manage both personal and professional repositories. As such, my previous employer GitHub account is no longer being updated in favor of my personal GitHub. Everything is private, but you can see general development activity during my time there.

The account can be found at [https://github.com/jonathan-fsa](https://github.com/jonathan-fsa)
