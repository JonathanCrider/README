# Hello!

## Me

I'm [Jonathan](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jonathandev/), a software engineer with a twist—starting my career in communications, marketing, and live event production before diving headfirst into tech. You could say my journey from wrangling middle schoolers to wrangling APIs has been anything but ordinary. Along the way, I’ve developed a knack for problem-solving, cross-functional collaboration, and turning complexity into streamlined solutions (all while keeping my sanity intact and my coffee cup full).

## Engineering Experience

I specialize in backend development, with a proven track record of building and maintaining REST APIs using Node.js, TypeScript, and Express. Recently, I've expanded into systems observability, configuring Linux servers and implementing monitoring solutions with Grafana and Prometheus. My professional experience includes integrating complex business logic into APIs, reducing engineering time by 96% for B2B partner onboarding, and achieving a 12% improvement in customer retention through API refactoring.

## Current Learning Path

While my public [GitHub repositories](https://github.com/JonathanCrider) represent only a portion of my work, my passion for backend development has led me to dive deeper into systems and infrastructure through [Boot.dev's](https://www.boot.dev/) courses. I've completed their Python track and am currently focusing on SQL and Linux administration, with plans to tackle Go and Docker next. As a bonus, I'm reinforcing these fundamentals while teaching my kiddo his first programming language!

## Extra Curriculars

When I’m off the clock, you’ll find me camping with my family on Lake Michigan, riding my motorcycle, or playing bass on weekends. I love introducing my kids to timeless movie franchises like Lord of the Rings and Star Wars, as well as diving into homelab projects like setting up an Ubuntu server to host Minecraft games, using Raspberry Pi for network filtering, and writing bash scripts to automate tasks. And yes, I’ve been known to hold entire conversations exclusively in gifs—that's a hard G, it's not peanut butter.

## Let's Connect!

While I might not ace every algorithm question in interviews, I thrive in real-world engineering challenges. I've consistently delivered value by taming chaotic workflows, integrating complex systems, and finding pragmatic solutions to business problems. I'm confident I can bring this same practical problem-solving approach to your team.

If you're looking for someone who brings creativity, integrity, and a bit of humor to the table, let's connect! I'm always open to opportunities where I can collaborate, grow, and contribute to something meaningful.

### Previous Employer GitHub Account

This GitHub account was created a long time ago, but I have been using it exclusively since moving on from my previous employer.

GitHub [recommends using a single account](https://docs.github.com/en/account-and-profile/setting-up-and-managing-your-personal-account-on-github/managing-your-personal-account/merging-multiple-personal-accounts) to manage both personal and professional repositories. As such, my previous employer GitHub account is no longer being updated in favor of my personal GitHub. All work was done in private repositories, but you can see general development activity during my time there.

My old employer-specific account can be found at [https://github.com/jonathan-fsa](https://github.com/jonathan-fsa)
