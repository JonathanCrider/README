# Welcome to my GitHub!

Hello! I'm a software engineer with a twist—starting my career in communications, marketing, and live event production before diving headfirst into tech. You could say my journey from wrangling middle schoolers to wrangling APIs has been anything but ordinary. Along the way, I’ve developed a knack for problem-solving, cross-functional collaboration, and turning complexity into streamlined solutions (all while keeping my sanity intact and my coffee cup full).

I specialize in backend development using Node.js, TypeScript, and Express, integrating third-party tools, and taming chaotic workflows. My experience includes building APIs, streamlining processes, and working extensively with HubSpot as a database of sorts. I’m also fluent in memes and excel at quickly learning new technologies to solve problems effectively. If you're wondering whether I’d be a great fit: almost certainly. I’m confident I can bring value to your team—let’s skip the hard sell and talk about how I can contribute to your goals instead!

When I’m off the clock, you’ll find me camping with my family on Lake Michigan, riding my motorcycle, or playing bass on weekends. I love introducing my kids to timeless movie franchises like Lord of the Rings and Star Wars, as well as diving into homelab projects like setting up an Ubuntu server to host Minecraft games, using Raspberry Pi for network filtering, and writing bash scripts to automate tasks. And yes, I’ve been known to hold entire conversations exclusively in gifs—that's a hard G, it's not peanut butter.

I’m continually studying, exploring, and re-learning various technologies. Many of the public repositories on my [GitHub account](https://github.com/JonathanCrider) showcase past projects and ongoing experiments, but I’m always working on and adding new ones! Currently, I’m honing my backend skills and learning Python through the fun and challenging Boot.dev platform. Bonus: I’m also revisiting some of the Python lessons with my kiddo—double win!

If you're looking for someone who brings creativity, integrity, and a bit of humor to the table, let’s connect! I’m always open to opportunities where I can collaborate, grow, and contribute to something meaningful.

## Previous Employer GitHub Account

This GitHub account was created a long time ago, but I have been using it exclusively since moving on from my previous employer.

GitHub [recommends using a single account](https://docs.github.com/en/account-and-profile/setting-up-and-managing-your-personal-account-on-github/managing-your-personal-account/merging-multiple-personal-accounts) to manage both personal and professional repositories. As such, my previous employer GitHub account is no longer being updated in favor of my personal GitHub. All work was done in private repositories, but you can see general development activity during my time there.

My old employer-specific account can be found at [https://github.com/jonathan-fsa](https://github.com/jonathan-fsa)
