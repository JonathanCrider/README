# Welcome to my GitHub!

This account was created a long time ago, but I have become active in it over the past several months since moving on from my previous employer.

I am continually studying, exploring, and re-learning various technlogies. Many of the public repositories in this account are old projects, but I am always working on and adding new things!

Currently upskilling/learning Python on the very fun [boot.dev](https://www.boot.dev) platform. Also going back through previous lessions with the kiddo, so double win!

## Previous Employer GitHub Account

GitHub [recommends using a single account](https://docs.github.com/en/account-and-profile/setting-up-and-managing-your-personal-account-on-github/managing-your-personal-account/merging-multiple-personal-accounts) to manage both personal and professional repositories. As such, my previous employer GitHub account is no longer being updated in favor of my personal GitHub. Everything is private, but you can see general development activity during my time there.

The account can be found at [https://github.com/jonathan-fsa](https://github.com/jonathan-fsa)
