# Welcome to my GitHub!

Hi there! I'm a software engineer with a twist—starting my career in communications, marketing, and live event production before diving headfirst into tech. You could say my journey from wrangling middle schoolers to wrangling APIs has been anything but ordinary. Along the way, I’ve picked up a knack for problem-solving, cross-functional collaboration, and turning complexity into streamlined solutions (all while keeping my sanity intact and my coffee cup full).

I specialize in backend development using Node.js, TypeScript, and Express, integrating third-party tools, and taming chaotic workflows. My experience includes building APIs, streamlining processes, and working extensively with HubSpot as a database of sorts. I’m also proficient in communicating via memes and excel at quickly picking up new technologies to solve problems effectively. If you're wondering whether I’d be a great fit: almost certainly. I’m confident I can bring value to your team. Let’s skip the hard sell and talk about how I can contribute to your goals instead!

When I’m off the clock, you’ll probably find me camping with my family on Lake Michigan, riding my motorcycle, or playing bass on weekends. I enjoy introducing my kids to timeless movie franchises like Lord of the Rings and Star Wars, as well as diving into homelab projects like setting up Ubuntu servers to run Minecraft, using Raspberry Pi for DNS filtering, and writing bash scripts to automate tasks. I have been known to hold conversations exclusively in gifs—that's a hard G, we're not discussing peanut butter here.

I am continually studying, exploring, and re-learning various technlogies. Many of the public repositories in this account are old projects, but I am always working on and adding new things! Currently, I am honing my backend skills and learning Python on the very fun [boot.dev](https://www.boot.dev) platform. Also going back through previous lessions with the kiddo, so double win!

If you're looking for someone who brings creativity, integrity, and a bit of humor to the table, let’s connect! I’m always open to opportunities where I can collaborate, grow, and contribute to something meaningful.

## Previous Employer GitHub Account

This GitHub account was created a long time ago, but I have been using it exclusively since moving on from my previous employer.

GitHub [recommends using a single account](https://docs.github.com/en/account-and-profile/setting-up-and-managing-your-personal-account-on-github/managing-your-personal-account/merging-multiple-personal-accounts) to manage both personal and professional repositories. As such, my previous employer GitHub account is no longer being updated in favor of my personal GitHub. All work was done in private repositories, but you can see general development activity during my time there.

My old employer-specific account can be found at [https://github.com/jonathan-fsa](https://github.com/jonathan-fsa)
